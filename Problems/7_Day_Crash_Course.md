# 🧠 7-Day LeetCode Crash Course: Pattern Recognition & Fundamentals

Welcome to a focused, high-impact 7-day crash course designed to **build your problem-solving intuition** and strengthen your core understanding of data structures and algorithms.

> ⚠️ **Goal:** Not to solve every problem perfectly — but to:
>
> - ✅ Recognize common problem patterns  
> - ✅ Understand the core data structures & algorithms  
> - ✅ Develop a repeatable breakdown process  
> - ✅ Communicate your thought process clearly

### 🔑 Key Principle: Quality over Quantity  
Understanding *why* a solution works is more valuable than solving dozens of problems without clarity.

## 📅 Day 1: Laying the Foundation – Arrays & Basic Pointers

**Concept Focus:**
- Arrays: Traversal, manipulation, fixed-size structures
- Two Pointers: Efficient technique for many array/string problems
- Prefix Sum (Intro): For range queries and cumulative calculations

**Problem Patterns:**
- Finding pairs
- Merging sorted arrays
- Reversing
- Removing duplicates

**Practice Plan:**
- 🔍 Watch: YouTube – *“Two Pointers algorithm explained”*, *“Prefix Sum technique”*
- 🧪 Problems:
  - `"Valid Palindrome"` – LeetCode [125]
  - `"Two Sum II - Sorted Input"` – LeetCode [167]
  - `"Two Sum"` – LeetCode [1] *(Fundamental for hash map intro later)*

**Pro Tip:** Think for 15–20 minutes before checking the solution. Don’t waste hours stuck.  
Then:  
1. Understand the *why* behind the solution  
2. Code it out yourself  
3. Teach it back aloud

## 📅 Day 2: Hash Maps & Frequency Counting

**Concept Focus:**
- Hash Maps: Key-value storage with average O(1) operations
- Frequency Counting: Tracking occurrences, solving lookup-heavy problems

**Problem Patterns:**
- Duplicates detection
- Unique/majority elements
- Character/word frequency

**Practice Plan:**
- 🔁 Review: Hash Map basics
- 🧪 Problems:
  - `"Contains Duplicate"` – LeetCode [217]
  - `"Valid Anagram"` – LeetCode [242]
  - `"Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"` – LeetCode [3]
  - Revisit `"Two Sum"` – LeetCode [1] with a hash map solution

**Ask Yourself:**  
- When do I use a hash map instead of an array?  
- How can a map reduce time complexity here?

## 📅 Day 3: Linked Lists & Recursion Basics

**Concept Focus:**
- Linked Lists: Pointers, nodes, null handling
- Dummy Nodes: Simplify edge case handling
- Recursion: Base case + recursive logic

**Problem Patterns:**
- Reversal
- Merging
- Cycle detection
- Deletion

**Practice Plan:**
- ✏️ Visualize: Draw linked lists and pointer flows
- 🧪 Problems:
  - `"Reverse Linked List"` – LeetCode [206]
  - `"Merge Two Sorted Lists"` – LeetCode [21]
  - `"Delete Node in a Linked List"` – LeetCode [237]
  - `"Middle of the Linked List"` – LeetCode [876]

**Focus:** Null checks, `.next` logic, and dummy node tricks.

## 📅 Day 4: Trees & BFS/DFS Traversal

**Concept Focus:**
- Binary Trees: Structure & navigation
- BFS (Queue): Level-by-level
- DFS (Stack/Recursion): In-order, pre-order, post-order

**Problem Patterns:**
- Max depth
- Tree equality
- Inversion
- Level order traversal

**Practice Plan:**
- 🌳 Visualize: Use animations or hand-drawn steps
- 🧪 Problems:
  - `"Maximum Depth of Binary Tree"` – LeetCode [104]
  - `"Same Tree"` – LeetCode [100]
  - `"Invert Binary Tree"` – LeetCode [226]
  - `"Binary Tree Level Order Traversal"` – LeetCode [102]

**Key Insight:**  
- BFS = use a queue  
- DFS = use recursion or a stack

## 📅 Day 5: Sliding Window (Advanced Arrays/Strings)

**Concept Focus:**
- Sliding Window: Dynamic range technique for subarrays/substrings
- Often paired with hash maps for tracking

**Problem Patterns:**
- Longest/shortest substrings
- Character frequency windows
- Matching substrings

**Practice Plan:**
- 🎥 Watch: *“Sliding Window Explained”*
- 🧪 Problems:
  - `"Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"` – LeetCode [3] *(Revisit)*
  - `"Permutation in String"` – LeetCode [567]
  - `"Minimum Window Substring"` – LeetCode [76]

**Tips:** Define the window clearly. Know when to expand, when to shrink.

## 📅 Day 6: Graphs & BFS/DFS on Graphs

**Concept Focus:**
- Graphs: Vertices + edges; adjacency lists vs. matrices
- BFS/DFS: Applied to graph traversal, cycle detection
- Grids as implicit graphs

**Problem Patterns:**
- Connected components
- Path existence
- Shortest paths

**Practice Plan:**
- 🧭 Understand: Graph representations & traversal logic
- 🧪 Problems:
  - `"Number of Islands"` – LeetCode [200]
  - `"Find if Path Exists in Graph"` – LeetCode [1971]
  - `"Clone Graph"` – LeetCode [133]
